                  ## **How to Resolve a Merge Conflict (Step-by-Step)**
                  1. **Checkout your PR branch:**
                  \`\`\`bash
                  git checkout ${pr.head.ref}
                  \`\`\`

                  2. **Fetch the latest changes from the main branch:**
                     \`\`\`bash
                     git fetch origin
                     git pull origin ${pr.base.ref}
                     \`\`\`
                  
                  3. **Git will show conflict markers in files with conflicts. Open those files, and manually edit them to resolve the differences. Conflict sections look like:**
                     \`\`\`
                     <<<<<<< HEAD
                     Your changes
                     =======
                     Changes from base branch
                     >>>>>>> ${pr.base.ref}
                     \`\`\`
                  
                  4. **After resolving the conflicts, mark them as resolved:**
                     \`\`\`bash
                     git add <file(s)-you-resolved>
                     \`\`\`
                  
                  5. **Commit the resolution:**
                     \`\`\`bash
                     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
                     \`\`\`
                  
                  6. **Push your updated branch:**
                     \`\`\`bash
                     git push origin ${pr.head.ref}
                     \`\`\`
